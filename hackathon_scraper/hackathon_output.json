All parties should be clear about their goals going into an event and consider the attainability and clarity of these goals. A failure to consider them could result in disappointment among participants and organizers.", "Setting goals for the hackathon should take place ", ". A common timeframe is to form goals about 4 months before the start of the event. Before deciding for one or multiple goals the organizers can consult with projected future participants ", " and potential stakeholders ", " about the value and feasibility of the projected goals and continue discussions about details after the general direction has been set.", "Organizers, stakeholders, and participants are involved in setting goals for their hackathon. In practice, organizers often set initial goals and modify them in collaboration with stakeholders, which is done in the early phase of hackathon planning. Participants are often also asked to express their goals for the event through e.g. a pre-hackathon survey ", ". It is important to note here that the organizers’ goals may not always be aligned with those of the participants. For example, organizers might aim to foster entrepreneurship whereas participants simply aim to pursue their interest related to a particular topic or project. It is not necessary that organizers and participants have identical goals, but organizers should be aware of potential goal disparities and take necessary actions to maximize the satisfaction of participants with different goals ", ". The participants, for example, might have a superset of the organizers’ goals, or the organizers’ goals may be achievable even if only a subset of participants shares them. The organizers should be aware though if goals are incompatible, (e.g. the organizers want to benefit a charity, while the participants mainly want to start a business), the participants may have unrealistic expectations and leave disappointed. It would be wise for organizers to adapt their recruiting approach ", " and their messaging to attract attendees with compatible goals.", "There are several goals that organizers may aim to achieve when organizing a hackathon. Clarity of goals is strongly related to participant satisfaction and outcome quality ", ".", "The most common goal around which hackathons are organized is the ", ". We observe two different strategies that organizers use to achieve this goal. The first strategy involves the recruitment of experts from different fields ", " and the facilitation of brainstorming ", " to produce cross-pollinated project ideas. Brainstorming has also been found to be associated with better outcomes for self-identified minorities ", ". The organizers using this strategy should devote most of their effort on recruiting stakeholders ", " from diverse groups that will benefit from meeting and working with each other. For example, they might include local startup communities, volunteers and activists, non-profits, accelerator programs, investors, technology companies and others. Moreover, organizers should design their events in a way that fosters participants to meet and work with people outside their regular networks and contribute to initiatives outside their usual scope. The sections dedicated to ideation ", " and duration/breaks ", " contain helpful ideas to facilitate networking among participants. One common example are regular checkpoints ", " to ensure that participants communicate with each other about their projects several times during the event. For example, a series of hackathons organized by Garage48 ", " aims to foster the startup ecosystem by connecting entrepreneurs with domain experts, investors, accelerators and others. Similarly, BioInnovation Days ", " gathers together students, researchers, mentors, and startups to develop prototypes in the domain of bio-medicine. The Global hack ", " is a recent example of an online movement where enthusiasts from different countries hosted several hackathons to address the global pandemic.", "The second strategy is teaming up experts and novices as mentors and apprentices, which enables the positive side effects of vertical ", ". Hackathons adopting this strategy should focus their efforts on identifying experts in the field and themes of their events, abilities of participants, modularization of projects to support parallelism, and the use of relevant mentoring strategies ", ". One example of this type of hackathon is Astro Hack Week ", " where a diverse group of participants ranging from novices to experts in the fields of astronomy, physics, statistics, machine learning, and data science gather together to learn skills necessary for the analysis of astronomical data through tutorials and then solve open problems in the astronomical community. Another example is a series of hackathons organized by the team at Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) managing the science program and operations of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) ", " where astronomers and software engineers are teamed up to facilitate fruitful cross-domain discussions among them. World of Code ", " is another example for a hackathon where students are teamed up with faculty members to learn how to do quantitative research on the behaviors of open source software (OSS) projects through the world’s largest OSS dataset.", "Most hackathons focus on a specific theme. A theme refers to a specific topic or cause that motivates the organization of a hackathon which in turn sets its boundary. A theme helps organizers to address a particular topical area and devise solutions for problems within this area.", "Organizing a hackathon commonly starts with a theme. Themes are generally developed in conjunction with the goals of a hackathon ", ", typically 4 months ahead of the hackathon.", "While the decision for a specific theme resides with the organizers, it is advisable to discuss it with relevant stakeholders such as non-profits, investors, educational institutions or others ", ".", "The organizers should decide the initial theme of the event and invite potential stakeholders interested in their proposed theme to discuss its feasibility and develop project ideas related to this theme. Themes can range from general to specific, e.g. fighting a global crisis ", ", mining a large-scale open source data source ", ", building cybersecurity solutions and teaching cybersecurity skills ", ", learning data science through solving astronomical and geo challenges ", ", computational biology ", ", neuroscience ", ", environmental issues ", ", and high performance computing ", ".", "The theme focuses potential project ideas on immediate needs or outstanding challenges in the chosen area. One such need is to ", ". A series of hackathons by a team of the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) that manages science programs and conducts experiments on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) ", " is one such example. In this case events were organized to speed up the conversion of tools to a language,  bringing together individuals who are using such tools for their work. Hackathons organized by Garage48 ", " are other examples of speeding up the development of cybersecurity solutions. Another need is solving outstanding challenges which could take a form of technical debt or scientific advancement. A team participating in a corporate hackathon we studied ", ", for example, utilized the time during that hackathon to implement a tool to automate recurring manual work.", "Another reason for choosing a specific theme is ", ". Astro hack week ", " and Geo Hack Week ", " are examples of this type where participants are first trained to apply basic analysis and coding skills and gather domain knowledge before moving on to solve challenges in the respective domains. Singapore’s BrainHack of the Organization for Human Brain Mapping (OHBM) in 2018 ", " is another example. There the organizers held parallel training and hacking tracks to get participants up to speed with technologies and approaches they might require to work on projects in this domain.", "A theme might also be chosen to ", ". One example for this is the World of Code (WoC) hackathon ", " that aimed to bring interested researchers and together and identify requirements for a large archive of open source data. Another example are events organized by the Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF) which aims at improving and extending existing resources and infrastructure and publishing papers about the accomplished work ", ".", "One key decision that organizers need to make when designing a hackathon is whether to provide external incentives in the form of prizes, which introduces a strong element of competition into an event.", "The decision whether to have a competitive or collaborative hackathon should be made several months before an event. Competitive events, in particular, take considerable time to organize. Organizers must find credible judges, decide on suitable award criteria, determine prizes and prize categories, and ensure that prizes can be handed out at the end of an event. If the prizes have considerable monetary value or will involve a time commitment from experts whose time is very limited (e.g., the opportunity to pitch the team’s winning idea to potential investors), there may be considerable work for the organizers to secure sponsorship.", "Organizers, sponsors, and other stakeholders ", " involved in setting goals for a hackathon should consider whether and how to introduce competition to their event. It is also extremely important to consider the goals of participants -- picking a structure that does not further their goals will make recruiting ", " difficult. If participant goals are not clear to the organizers, a brief survey or interviews with a sample of the population of interested participants can be very helpful.", " are typically structured around a ", " ", " ", " ", ". An example for cooperative events is a series of cooperative hackathons ", " that was organized to accelerate the development of integrated web services in the field of bioinformatics. Teams there worked on projects involving data standardization and interoperability of tools and services among others. Other cooperative hackathons aim to perfect an artifact. For example, the Debian Linux project launched the Debcamp event ", ", a hacking session before the Debian Conference, where software developers whose work depends on the Debian Linux software distribution worked together to promote the redistribution, general availability, and mutual compatibility of software. Another example is a corporate hackathon series organized by STScI’s Hubble Space Telescope team that aimed to accelerate the migration of data analysis tools implemented in an old obsolescing language to a contemporary one ", ".", " focus on teams winning prizes. Winners can be selected by a ", " or based on a ", ". Some hackathons also award special prizes to projects that meet specific challenges posed by sponsors or other stakeholders. If winners are selected by a jury, it is necessary to invite judges and to specify suitable judging criteria. For judges, the organizers may consider recruiting (domain) experts from a university, community leaders, or representatives from tech companies ", ". Some commonly used judging criteria include appeal to market, creativity, originality, completeness and level of difficulty. For a competition to be perceived as fair, it is important that judging criteria are well known in advance and that organizers make sure that participants do not simply turn up with solutions that have been built prior to the event. There are different approaches to award prizes based on a popular vote. Voting can e.g. be limited to on-site participants only or it can be replaced or augmented by online voting. The latter requires an online voting system as well as final presentation sessions to be live-streamed or presentation materials to be distributed online.", "In order to select the winning teams, the organizers should create a dedicated session at the conclusion of a hackathon to allow each participating team to pitch and demonstrate their idea to the entire audience of an event. This session could take the form either of an ", " or a ", ". In the former approach, each team is typically given a set time to present their prototypes in front of the entire event audience. For this it is important to inform participants in advance how their presentation will be evaluated, the presentation format, and the time limit. The commonly used presentation format starts with a brief introduction of team members and problems that they tried to solve, which is followed by a live demo ", ". It is also possible that teams record a short introductory video and focus on their demo during the presentation. In a (science) fair style presentation session ", ", each team is commonly allocated a booth in a large-enough space to set up their presentations and judges and visitors visit each booth to interact with the teams. This approach facilitates a greater face-to-face interaction between participants, judges, and other attendees. At the Microsoft OneWeek Hackathon we observed ", ", teams could both attend a science fair and upload a video to an online platform where other participants and observers could vote on their favorite projects. This online voting enables individuals who are not able to attend the fair in person to participate in winner selection. ", "Prizes can vary greatly, with tech gadgets, cash prizes and opportunities for continued development of winning ideas probably being the most common. The opportunities for further development can take the form of providing additional resources, computing power, freeing up participants’ time to work on their project post-hackathon, or simply the opportunity to pitch their idea to top executives or investors. Awarding cash prizes is not always feasible or recommended approach ", ". Major League Hacking (MLH) for example provides a few non-cash prize ideas ", " such as laptops, headphones, conference tickets, etc. as alternatives. Moreover, hackathon organizers need to decide for ", " they offer in relation to the number of participating teams. Offering many prizes at a small event might reduce their perceived value which in turn can negatively affect participant motivation ", ".", "Hackathons commonly focus on a specific theme ", " or take place in a specific domain. It thus appears reasonable to include stakeholders related to this theme or domain to participate in the organization, execution and follow-up of a hackathon. They can provide valuable input, help set the stage of an event, make it more engaging and fun for participants and support the sustainability of hackathon outcomes ", ". Deciding about how and when to involve stakeholders in the planning and execution of a hackathon is thus a crucial decision that organizers have to take because it will fundamentally shape the experience of participants during the hackathon.", "Organizers should think about which stakeholders to involve early in the planning process because their input might have a considerable impact on the design of the event itself. The way each stakeholder participates in the planning, execution and follow-up of a hackathon is then subject to individual planning and can potentially happen later in the planning process. Stakeholders and their role in relation to the hackathon should however be decided upon and announced prior to the start of the hackathon to be able to include them in information material.", "While conducting a traditional stakeholder analysis ", " might be too time-consuming, organizers certainly should think about who might be interested in or affected by the outcomes of the hackathon they plan to organize. Depending on the theme of the event organizers might want to involve university departments (e.g. for a collegiate event ", "); investors, incubators, and customers (e.g. for an entrepreneurial event ", "); managers and executives (e.g. for a corporate event ", "); volunteers and activists (e.g. for a civic event ", "); scientists and technical experts (e.g. for a scientific event ", "). These are just a few examples for potential stakeholders. The decision for whom to involve and how to involve them ultimately lies in the hands of the organizers.", "Much like the decision for which stakeholders to involve, the decision for how to involve them allows many options. In the following we will outline common examples for stakeholder involvement. These should however not be perceived as exhaustive. Organizers should discuss options with stakeholders and decide for a model that fits their particular event.", "One common way of involving stakeholders in a hackathon is as ", ". This can include them providing resources in exchange for being mentioned on the hackathon website, in handouts or on posters at the hackathon site or them providing specialized equipment or sponsoring awards or specific activities during a hackathon. The website of Major League Hacking provides a good overview on how to attract sponsors including different sponsorship options ", ". The advantage of this approach is that the outline and organization of a hackathon remains solely in the hands of the organizers while sponsors provide additional resources for the hackathon to take place.", "Another common way of stakeholder involvement is to invite them as ", ". Similarly, stakeholders can also hold ", " during an event e.g. related to specific technologies they are familiar with and that participants might use for their projects. Both approaches allow stakeholders to be present during an event and provide useful context and input for participants that they can utilize when planning and working on their projects. Moreover, it leaves the option for participants to decide whether to use the input for their projects or not.", "Another common way of involving stakeholders in a hackathon is for them to serve as ", " ", " or ", ". Serving as mentors -- in comparison to the aforementioned role as speakers or trainers -- allows stakeholders to directly work with participants, provide targeted feedback and steer them into a specific direction ", " and foster learning ", ". Utilizing stakeholders as jurors can also be beneficial because they can provide realistic project assessments based on their area of expertise and again provide useful feedback to participants when discussing their verdict.", "In addition to serving in the aforementioned roles, stakeholders can also ", " in the form of datasets, documentation and access to interested parties such as potential future customers or domain experts ", ". This requires them to be accessible during the hackathon but it allows participants to seek input and advice on demand.", "For some hackathons it might also be feasible for stakeholders to ", " for the participants to address ", ". We observed this model mainly in scientific hackathons where scientists proposed project areas or challenges that were related to their area of expertise or that would help them in their work. Participants can then choose which challenge or project to address and how to address it.", "Finally, stakeholders can of course also attend an event as ", " or serve as ", ". This is particularly common for corporate hackathons where organizers and participants often are employees of the same company that organizes the event ", ". Involving stakeholders as participants can however be difficult especially in an open event that welcomes individuals from various domains and backgrounds since stakeholders might be inclined to take over projects and adjust them to fit their ideas or goals.", "Participant recruitment is one of the most crucial elements of hackathon design. After defining goals ", " and themes ", " for the hackathon, organizers should ask themselves: Who would be the target audience for an event? When should they start recruitment? How to draw interest and attention to an event? We will provide suggestions for those in the following.", "Participants need to be recruited and have to register before the hackathon. The exact time that recruitment needs to occur varies based on the scope of the event, the degree to which the target audience is known, and the amount of planning needed for potential participants to take part in a hackathon (i.e. location and time). As such the organizers should discuss who they would want to participate at the very beginning of the event organization before they develop or deploy any recruitment strategy. Organizers sometimes recruit participants up to a year before an event as e.g. in the case of events for specialized communities such as Astro Hack Week ", " or Geo Hack Week ", ". Other events such as collegiate hackathons sponsored by Major League Hacking typically start recruitment about two months before the actual event ", ".\n", "Taking their event goals ", " and themes ", " into consideration, the organizers should identify the characteristics of the target audience they aim to recruit. For some events with broad appeal, ", " may be sufficiently specific. For others, e.g. ", " the recruitment efforts will have to be very targeted and provide compelling motivation for that particular population. Stakeholders ", " that are connected to the targeted audience can support this recruitment process.", "There are two general strategies for participant recruitment: ", ". The organizers should decide which strategy to use based on the goals of their hackathon. Open recruitment targets a wide range of participants with the aim to diversify participation. As such, open recruitment is typically used for hackathons whose main goal is to build a community around the cause or theme. The aforementioned hackathons  Astro Hack Week ", " and Geo Hack Week ", " used open recruitment inviting anyone with an interest in astronomy and data science. Alternatively, the organizers could also use closed recruitment thus only inviting specific participants who e.g. are internal to a specific community. Examples for such hackathons are Microsoft’s OneWeek Hackathon ", " and the STScI hack days ", " who only recruited among their employees. Many tech companies hold such events to foster innovation, to promote a more open and innovative culture, and to help create richer and farther-reaching social ties ", ". If the event is a community event, organizers need to identify and invite individuals who might be interested in the particular cause or theme that serves as the ", " for the community. Hackathons mostly are recurring events that are sometimes held by groups, such as scientific research communities, who have continuous needs to train members, maintain or implement new features, or work on interoperability issues for shared tools. The HackWeek Toolkit provides detailed suggestions for defining a suitable audience and scope an event to the needs of specific communities ", ".", "After the target audience is identified, organizers should set up a ", " such as dates and venue, contact information to enable interested participants to communicate with the organizers, and a registration form. The process of setting up and publishing a website can be streamlined by e.g. creating a repository on GitHub as in the case of the World of Code (WoC) hackathon ", ". It is helpful for the organizers to decide on a particular hosting platform, e.g., GitHub, before the event. The organizers should then publicize the website to potential interested participants. When using a GitHub project URL organizers can also encourage interested participants to communicate with them via GitHub issues. In addition to providing information the organizers should also provide contact information and be accessible for potential participants via email and Slack.", "The organizers should also create a ", " form using e.g. Google Forms which should be accessible from the website. Through this registration form organizers can also collect additional information about participants’ skills and background, preference of projects and areas, and goals and expectations if they decide to do so. Forms can also include open text boxes to allow participants to propose project ideas ", " or indicate if they are planning to come as a team ", ".", " an event is typically done by disseminating the previously discussed website to potentially interested individuals through various channels such as processional networks, mailing lists, student groups, university departments, personal networks, and social media such as twitter and Facebook groups depending on the target audience ", ". The organizers could also send direct email invitations to individuals who might be interested in taking part in the hackathon as participants or who might promote the event to potentially interested individuals.", "While ", " of participants is often preferred because that it allows every registrant to take part in the event, some hackathons organizers decide to ", " ", ". Reasons for selection might be constraints such as the maximum capacity of a venue, funding, etc. as well as to broaden participation from various communities. As described earlier, the choice of the strategy is very much dependent on the event. For example, if the goal of the event is to broaden participation in a specific software development community and most registrants are predominantly from a single institution or background, the organizers might want to consider deploying other strategies to broaden their reach. For hackathons with a learning goal, the organizers should a mix of more and less experienced participants. Likewise, hackathons that aim to foster entrepreneurship or the development of sustainable artifacts might want to attract participants from diverse backgrounds and expertise ", ". One approach that seems promising is organizing a mini-hackathon with participants from the community that they wish to attract prior to the main event. This approach has been successfully deployed by the ", " ", " hackathon. This is an all-women hackathon which aims to get women participants familiarized with the hacking process before they move on to events with more diverse participants.", "Moreover, ", ", at best right after the event theme and goals are formulated. This gives organizers more time to adjust their recruitment strategy when needed, increasing the chance to attract a sufficient number of participants that fit their desired profile. For large events, using an online tool can be helpful for the selection process. Entrofy ", " is an example for such a tool that allows organizers to extract a subset of registered participants based on certain attributes e.g. gender, career stage, etc., and given value (i.e. the percentage of distribution for each attribute).", "Organizers might want to run a hackathon related to a specific theme ", ", in a specific domain or utilize specific software and hardware during their event that are not commonly available to participants. Such events thus potentially require the organizers to provide trainings, access to licenses or hardware for participants to be able to work on projects during this hackathon.", "Preparation activities can be done remotely, onsite, or both. If the theme ", " and goals ", " will likely require specialized technical knowledge (e.g. particular tools, languages, or frameworks) or domain knowledge (e.g. community needs, or a scientific field) it is important to develop ways to bring participants up to speed before (usually 1 to 3 weeks) or very early during the event. The organizers may also want to facilitate team meetings if teams are formed in advance ", " so that they could discuss project scope and plan, assign tasks, and experiment with technologies to be used during the hackathon. Assuming participants have free time and sufficient motivation, this can help the work move along more quickly when the hackathon begins.", "The organizers should work with mentors ", " to coordinate training programs. Mentors will in fact often be running those programs, since they are typically chosen based on their expertise. For hackathons when team formation ", " occurs in advance, it is advisable that the team leaders are chosen, so they can organize team meetings.  Organizers can also encourage projected participants to prepare for the hackathon by e.g. setting up a code base in advance ", " or study technologies that they might want to use for their project.", "The organizers first need to identify ", " for people to participate in their event and to what extent participants should know about them before coming to the event. One common way to help achieve this is for organizers to arrange training programs in which participants are taught specific technologies or domain knowledge that they would need to use at the event. These programs can consist of webinars developed by the organizers, or pointers to existing resources that are available, e.g. on Youtube, or the Coding Academy website ", " and that projected participants can use to prepare themselves ", ".", "The organizers should ensure that the tutorial materials are ", " to all participants. This typically includes posting them on the hackathon website, the collaboration platform through which the hackathon is organized, e.g. GitHub, or other document sharing tools, e.g. GoogleDrive.", " are often delivered as pre-recorded videos with interactive Q&A at scheduled times. If the training, for example, is related to the configuration of the development environment, participants can watch a pre-recorded video, replicate the steps shown in the video, and communicate with trainers during the Q&A session and/or via emails. Alternatively, tutorials can be delivered live by a mentor ", " which guides a group of participants through activities interactively. For groups of larger size, it might be advisable to form smaller subgroups of perhaps 5 to 10 participants, each guided by one mentor. In practice, live tutorials can present a scheduling challenge, as it might not always be possible to find a common time for all participants particularly when they are geographically distributed. Moreover, tutorials may also need to be customized based on the participants’ skill levels, e.g. novices need foundational knowledge first before learning advanced skills while experienced participants might want to skip such basics ", ". In such situations, it is advisable that organizers cluster participants into groups of similar skills and provide appropriate materials for each group. The World of Code (WoC) hackathon ", " is an example where mentors trained participants in small group tutorials in real-time a few days before the event via Skype.", "For hackathons that wish to train participants onsite, we have observed two approaches that can be effective. The first approach is ", " as done by Astro Hack Week ", " and Geo Hack Week ", ". In this approach, participants spend most of their time hacking, while also spending a considerable amount of time (e.g. 25-50%) on training of particular skills and domain knowledge required to conduct research work afterwards. The second approach is participants ", ". An example of the second approach is high performance computing (HPC) hackathons which run in parallel with the super computing conference ", " where participants distribute their time between hacking and attending conference sessions. BrainHack 2018 of the Organization for Human Brain Mapping (OHBM) in Singapore ", " is another example that allows participants to swap between hacking and attending training sessions during a concurrent track.", "In case the hackathon involves ", ", the organizers might want to ensure that it arrives at the hackathon site early so that it can be set up before the participants arrived. Moreover, organizers might want to ensure that a specialist is on-site during the entire event that can help with technical issues.", "When organizing a hackathon, organizers have to decide when to start, when to end and when to take breaks in between. These decisions are crucial because they can influence who would be motivated to come, whether attendees can maintain a high level of motivation, how the event will be perceived and how participants engage with each other beyond working on their projects.", "The overall timeline of a hackathon needs to be decided on and announced early during the planning process since it serves as a basis for recruitment material ", " and for peoples’ decision to attend the event. The overall timeline should include dates and times (including start, end and potential overnight breaks) for each day. Other breaks during the hackathon can potentially be decided on and announced later.", "The decision for when a hackathon will take place, how long and it should be and how many breaks it will have is commonly taken by the organizers. For this decision they can consult projected participants ", ", mentors ", " and other stakeholders ", ". Including external stakeholders is especially advisable when the hackathon focuses on a specific theme ", ", takes place in a specific domain or aims to attract participants ", " from backgrounds that the organizers are not particularly familiar with.", "When thinking about a hackathon most people will probably think about an event that starts on a Friday afternoon, ends on a Sunday, runs overnight and has little to no breaks in between with teams just tirelessly hacking away on their project ", ". While this is a common hackathon format it certainly is not the only one. Organizers can decide for their event to take place at any point during the week and have breaks overnight as well as during the day. When deciding about the timing of their particular event, organizers should take the following aspects into account.", "They should consider the background of their ", " ", ". While it might be ok for students to participate in an event during the week and stay up overnight, this might not be possible for people that have fixed working times or busy family lives. Corporate events we studied often took place during regular working hours and participants could choose to go home for the night or stay and continue working ", ", while civic events often take place in the evening and can be spread out over multiple weeks with breaks during hacking times to allow for participants to network ", ".", "Another aspect to consider when deciding for the duration of an event is the ", " ", " an event takes place in. In a corporate setting it might be feasible to focus on regular working hours because relevant stakeholders that can e.g. serve as mentors or provide thematic input might only be available during certain times. These times can however be considerably different e.g. in a civic context where stakeholders may be more likely to be available after regular working hours.", "It is also important for organizers to consider their ", " ", " for organizing a hackathon when deciding about when to start, when to end and when to take breaks in between. If their goal is for teams to develop polished prototypes, they might want teams to focus on their project and thus not take too many breaks to not affect their productivity and rhythm. If the organizers’ goals should however be for participants to network, they might want to consider regular breaks during which participants can socialize.", "Breaks can also serve as opportunities for organizers to convene and discuss with mentors ", " and stakeholders ", " and potentially alter the course of an event. For example, during a community hackathon we studied, the organizers took time during a break to sort ideas proposed by participants to structure the following team formation process ", ".", "One of the main motivations for individuals to attend a hackathon is the prospect to work on an exciting project. It is thus crucial for organizers to think about how to support participants to come up with interesting and attainable project ideas they can work on during a hackathon. There is also evidence that some ideation approaches, such as traditional brainstorming, can help self-identified minorities feel more welcome and their ideas more accepted during the event ", ".", "Ideation typically takes place before the hackathon, but organizers can also plan for a dedicated ideation session at the beginning of the event itself.", "Participants typically propose their own ideas. Especially for ideation during the event, trained facilitators can help the participants generate ideas efficiently and harmoniously. It is also possible to guide ideation towards a certain direction that appears feasible and useful to organizers and / or connected stakeholders ", ".", "The most common ideation approach is for participants to develop ideas that are related to the ", " ", ". Hackathon themes are often intentionally broad covering areas such as civic technologies ", ", environmental sustainability ", ", entrepreneurship ", " and others to allow for a large variety of ideas to fit under their banner. Organizers and stakeholders can also decide to narrow the scope of potential ideas by proposing specific problems (areas) that participants should address. This approach is suitable for targeted events ", " that e.g. aim to develop technologies for a specific community ", ". It is important to leave space for participants to develop ideas that are of interest to them, to ensure their motivation to participate.", "Ideation can take place ", ". For larger audiences it might be advisable to collect ideas prior to an event using technologies such as Google Docs or GitHub issues. It is important to use technologies that projected participants are familiar with. Collecting ideas through such technologies not only allows participants to describe their ideas but also enables others to comment, provide feedback and express interest. They also allow organizers and stakeholders to pre-screen ideas, adjust their ideation approach and capture ideas for future use beyond the context of a particular hackathon ", ".", "Conducting a separate ideation session ", " using common approaches ", " such as brainstorming ", " might lead to more interaction between participants, organizers and mentors ", " and foster ideation. It also allows organizers to guide ideation by asking targeted questions ", " and clustering ideas e.g. based on participant interest.

Collecting many ", " ideas is, however, not the only aspect to consider during ideation. While being challenging enough to be interesting for participants to attempt and potentially continue after an event ", ", ideas should also be ", ". This means that they need to be doable during the short duration of a hackathon, that the team that attempts them has or can quickly attain the skills required to complete a project based on that idea, and that there are sufficient resources available at the hackathon, including, for example, specialized hardware, licenses, cloud resources, or others ", ". Organizers, stakeholders and mentors can support teams to select suitable ideas and help them scope their project during the hackathon.", "Finally, it is important to consider that ", ". If some ideas prove extremely popular, the idea can sometimes be split into parts, or several teams can be formed to pursue the same idea. If ideas are not popular at all it should be clear to all participants that they will not be attempted during the hackathon. Participants proposing ideas thus have to be prepared to let go of their idea and potentially join a different team and work on something else.", "Another important decision for organizers is selecting an appropriate strategy for selecting projects and forming teams. Teams are typically formed from the recruited participant pool ", ", around projects of interest to them.", "Participant recruitment ", " and ideation ", " are prerequisites for the team formation process. Team formation and project selection can take place either ", " or ", ". Each has its advantages and disadvantages, as we will discuss in the trade-offs below. Even if the intent is to choose teams and projects at the beginning of the event, organizers should expect that some participants may join the hackathon as a team, with firm ideas about what they want to work on, and with whom.", "There are three roles involved in the team formation and project selection process. These roles are project ", ", ", ", and ", ". The proposer refers to someone who pitches a project idea at the event. This role can be taken by participants, organizers or stakeholders ", ". The joiners are participants who selected the project they are interested in, sometimes also selecting a role that they would like to play at the event. For example, during Microsoft’s OneWeek Hackathon ", ", project proposers specified roles required for their proposed projects and other participants joined the project teams by taking one of these roles (cf. Microsoft HackBox ", "). The organizer or a dedicated person takes the role of moderator who facilitates the team formation process in order to configure project teams with skills, expertise, background, and reasonable size required to complete the projects they aim to work on. For hackathons at scale, it is important to assist the moderator with a tool that facilitates the matching of participants and projects.", "In order to successfully form teams with skills required to complete the projects proposed at a hackathon, it is often helpful to have a diverse participant pool ", ". Organizers try to attract suitable participants as part of participant selection and recruitment process which has to be finished before team formation.", "Teams can be formed either by ", ", ", ", or a ", " strategy. In open selection, participants select projects and roles that they want to play based on their interest from the list of all available projects and roles. In the assignment strategy, a mediator assigns projects and roles to participants. The hybrid strategy narrows down the participant’s search space by filtering out projects and roles that seem to be of lesser interest to participants or that they might be less qualified for. For assignment and hybrid strategy, it is important to gather participants’ needs and expectations beforehand to optimize team formation. Information like that is typically collected through the registration process as part of participant recruitment.", "Forming teams ", " requires suitable online tools such as Google Docs, Google Forms or GitHub issues. Suitable tools need to support project listing and sign up. For example, in the STScI hack days ", " we observed that Google Forms were used to collect project preferences and skills. Based on this information, the organizers configured  teams of 3 to 6 participants with a good mix of skills. Some hackathons, e.g. Steelhacks ", ", suggest participants to form teams of 5. These tools work well for smaller events (say, 50 or fewer participants) but a more sophisticated tool would be required for larger scale such as Microsoft’s OneWeek Hackathon. They deployed the online tool HackBox ", " that allowed participants to create projects proposal, sign up for projects and search for additional members with specific skills or interests.", "It is common for teams to form ", " ", ". This process needs to be fairly efficient so that teams will have sufficient time to actually work on their project. One common approach is to allow participants that have a project idea to pitch it in front of the other participants, and write each idea down on a flip chart or whiteboard ", ". The remaining participants are then given some time to walk around and chat with the project proposers and select a project they would like to work on. It is common to aim for teams of similar size between 3 and 6 members. It is particularly important for competitive hackathons ", " to have teams of similar size since a large difference between team sizes could lead to an unfair disadvantage for some teams.  Moreover, large teams should be avoided because they typically require additional coordination effort which can limit the time a team has to actually work on their project. They thus need to potentially be split up, and ideas that do not draw much interest are generally abandoned. In another small-scale hackathon we observed, organizers asked the participants to rank proposed projects in order of their preference in Google Docs and participants were assigned to the project on a first-come-first-serve basis. This process might not be feasible for events at scale and using a tool like HackBox would be necessary even if team formation occurred at the hackathon.", "For hackathons where teams are formed on site, it is sometimes desirable for organizers to propose projects, and either post descriptions in advance, develop brief pitches and make them available to participants as videos, or describe them at the beginning of an event. This approach is particularly useful when the goal ", " of a hackathon is, for example, to introduce newcomers to a particular domain, tool set, or scientific community. In these cases, it is very difficult for the projected participants to develop with feasible and appropriate project ideas themselves.", "In the following, we describe a number of trade-offs between various strategies used to configure teams in hackathons. It is important to note here that these trade-offs are not independent, and organizers should consider balancing them when making decisions about team formation and project selection.", "Like any other event hackathons need an agenda that outlines which activities will take place at which point in time.
